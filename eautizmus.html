        <h1>Autism</h1>
        <p>
            What is autism? What does it mean to live with it?
            You’ve probably met someone who understood certain situations differently than you did.
            This is completely normal because everyone sees the world from a different point of view.
            We all have social skills that we use every day — some of these are learned, and some are inherited. <br> <br>
            
            However, there are people who see the world differently not because of their personality,
            but because their basic social skills are affected or work in another way.
            
            This can mean many things. To put it simply, it might be harder for them to understand sarcasm,
            or to notice when someone else is feeling sad.
            
            These social skills help us build relationships and communicate more easily,
            because we use them automatically in everyday life.</p>

        <p>Imagine a world where no one ever asks: “You seem a bit down today, is everything okay?”
            These small questions may seem unimportant in today’s world,
            but we need them to help us deal with problems more easily.
            
            Autism spectrum disorder is a neurodevelopmental condition that shows up differently in every person,
            and in different levels. <br> <br>
            There are people with mild autism, moderate autism, and severe autism —
            although these are not official categories, they are used to describe different parts of the spectrum.
            
            In most cases, it’s hard for someone without experience to recognize the signs,
            but it is very important to try to understand the situation
            and be aware of all the surrounding factors.</p>    
            <img src="autizmus2.png" alt="">
        <p>Many people with autism spectrum disorder live almost completely typical lives,
            because they learn how to manage some of their difficulties.
            This allows them to attend regular schools and be part of everyday social groups.
            
            However, there are also people in the same situations who still find communication
            and building relationships extremely difficult.
            They may struggle to understand social situations, other people’s moods,
            humor in conversations, or things like sarcasm. <br> <br>
            
            Most of us recognize these things automatically through facial expressions
            or tone of voice, and we respond without thinking.
            But if someone doesn’t have these skills,
            you can imagine how hard it is for them to fit in and socialize.
            
            Our motivation in this topic is connected to our core values,
            such as empathy — which we feel toward people with autism and their families —
            as well as innovative thinking and problem-solving,
            which help us create our innovation.
            
            These are our two main motivations.
            Along with these core values, our team is also driven by persistence, dedication,
            and working together toward a shared goal.
