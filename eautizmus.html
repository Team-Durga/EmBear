        <h1>Autism</h1>
        <p>
            What is autism? What does it mean to live with it?
            Surely you’ve already met someone with whom you interpreted certain situations differently.
            This is completely ordinary, since every person sees the world from a different perspective. However,
            even our social skills include inherited and learned abilities that we use every single day. <br> <br> But there are people who do not see the world differently because of their personality, but because their basic social skills are impaired, or work differently.
            By this we can mean many situations, if we want to put it simply—such as recognizing sarcasm
            or noticing sadness in another person. These social skills make it easier to establish relationships and communication in everyday life, since we apply them automatically.</p>
            <img src="autizmus1.jpg" alt="">
        <p>Imagine a world where no one ever asks: “I see you’re a bit down today, is everything okay?”
            These small questions may sometimes seem insignificant in today’s world, but we need them in order to handle problems more easily.
            Autism spectrum disorder is a neurodevelopmental disorder, which manifests slightly differently and to varying degrees in everyone. <br> <br> There are people with mild autism,
            moderate autism, and severe autism, although these categories are not professional—they only describe different parts of the spectrum. In most cases,
            it is difficult for an untrained person to recognize the signs, but it is even more important
            that we can still assess the situation and try to understand all the surrounding factors.</p>    
            <img src="autizmus2.png" alt="">
        <p>Many people living with autism spectrum disorder manage their lives almost completely typically,
            because they learn to cope with certain difficulties. This way, they attend completely ordinary
            schools and social circles. However, there are also those among them who, living in the same situation,
            still find communication and relationship building extremely difficult. They struggle to recognize situations, people’s moods, humorous elements in a conversation, or the already mentioned sarcasm. <br> <br>
            Most of us recognize these automatically from facial expressions and intonation, and we respond reflexively. But if these skills do not function in a person,
            we can imagine how difficult integration and socialization must be for them.
            Our motivations in this topic are connected with our core values, which include empathy toward people living with autism and their families, as well as innovative thinking and problem-solving through which we create our innovation. These are our two main motivations, and alongside our core values, other forces also drive our team’s engine—for example perseverance, dedication, and shared goals.
