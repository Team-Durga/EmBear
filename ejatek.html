            People with autism spectrum disorder often face difficulties with nonverbal communication, especially in interpreting facial expressions. These difficulties can contribute to misunderstandings and communication barriers during social interactions. Put yourself to the test! <br> <br> How well can you recognize the emotions behind facial expressions?
            Identify the correct emotion! Be careful, it can be trickyâ€”an emotion can be expressed in different ways! <br> <br> Important: if you click on an answer button and do not move on to another question, unfortunately, your answer was incorrect. If you receive a new question, then your answer was correct. Have fun!
