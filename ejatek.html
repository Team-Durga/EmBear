            People with autism spectrum disorder often have difficulties with nonverbal communication, especially understanding facial expressions. These difficulties can lead to misunderstandings and communication barriers during social interactions.
            Try yourself! How well can you recognize the emotion behind different facial expressions? Identify the correct emotion! Be careful, some emotions can be shown in different ways and might be tricky!
